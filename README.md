# Implementing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
The SketchRNN dataset is a collection of hand-drawn sketches of various objects created by users on an online
platform. Each sketch consists of a sequence of pen strokes along with timing
information. The dataset is organized into categories such as animals, everyday
objects, and vehicles.
